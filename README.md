# CS-370-Current-Emerging-Trends-in-CS

For this project, I was provided the code for the GameExperience.py and TreasureMaze.py as well as all the code other than the section where the code for the Q-Training algorithm would go. The code for the Q-Training algorithm was written by me. This code was meant to teach an agent how to pathfind, specifically how to get a pirate NPC to a treasure chest. 

This course was very helpful in connecting the link between all sorts of web applications that we see daily, such as googles recommendations, or the new image generator DeepAI. We can see how the back-end interfaces with our neural network to get results that work. Computer scientists are responsible for the academic or theoretical parts of computer programming, it could be solving problems using math, then relaying the information to computer engineers who will build the application, or just developing whitepapers. However, everything computer scientists do is important to the field as progress cannot be made without them. 

To approach a problem as a computer scientist, I believe you have to approach it the same way as any other scientist would. Break down the problem, understand it completely, design a solution and implement it. If it works, you've succeeded, however, if it does not, you go back and iterate. Similar to how other scientists create hypotheses and test them.

The ethical responsibilities I believe we have to the end user and the organization are very complex but can be summarized by a simple phrase. "Do no harm." Creating software that harms people or invades their privacy goes against my ethical beliefs, and I hope that others similarly do not want to be a part of that.
